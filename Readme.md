- Deploy on cloud platforms for full scalability.

## User Flow

1. **Onboarding**: Users input their current skills, interests, and career goals.
2. **AI Skill Analysis**: The system recommends skills based on job market trends and user data.
3. **Course Recommendations**: Personalized course suggestions are provided based on skill level and time availability.
4. **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their learning progress through an analytics dashboard.
5. **Job Matching**: View real-world job opportunities that align with the skills they are learning.

## Next Steps

Currently, we are focusing on building the MVP, which will include:
- UI setup for user profiles and basic course recommendations.
- Job trends scraping for an initial industry.
- A simple version of the analytics dashboard.

We are looking for collaborators and contributors to help refine the user experience, integrate additional learning platforms, and deploy the platform.
